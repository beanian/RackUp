# RackUp User Guide

A simple guide to using RackUp — your digital pool scoreboard.

## What Is RackUp?

RackUp replaces the old chalkboard. It keeps score, tracks who's winning, and remembers everything so you can look back at stats and bragging rights later.

The app has **6 tabs** along the bottom of the screen:

| Tab | What it does |
|-----|-------------|
| **Home** | Start sessions, record frames, see this month's leaderboard |
| **Camera** | Live table camera preview and recording controls |
| **Players** | Add new players, rename them, pick emojis |
| **History** | Browse past sessions |
| **Recordings** | Watch back recorded frames |
| **Stats** | Player stats, head-to-head records, leaderboards |

## Adding Players (Do This First)

Before you can play, you need to add the players.

1. Tap the **Players** tab at the bottom
2. Tap the big **+ Add Player** button
3. Tap the emoji on the left to pick a custom emoji for that player (optional — defaults to a pool ball)
4. Type the player's name using the on-screen keyboard
5. Tap **Done** on the keyboard to save

To change a player's name or emoji later, tap **Rename** next to their name.

To remove a player you no longer need, tap **Archive**. Archived players can be restored at any time from the "Archived" section at the bottom of the Players page.

## Playing a Session

### Starting Up

1. Tap the **Home** tab
2. Tap the big **New Session** button
3. Tap each player who is playing — they highlight when selected
   - The order you tap them matters: the first two play the opening frame, the rest join the queue
4. If you want frames recorded on video, tick **Auto-Record Frames**
5. Tap **Start Session**

### Picking Who Plays

- **Player 1** is shown on the left — tap to choose a different player
- **Player 2** is shown on the right — tap to choose their opponent
- Once both are selected, you'll see the **Game On** screen

### Recording a Frame (Who Won)

This is the main thing you'll do:

1. Two big buttons show the current players — one on each side
2. **Tap the winner's name.** That's it!

What happens next:
- The frame is saved
- A win sound plays
- The **winner stays on** at the table
- The **loser goes to the back of the queue**
- The next challenger from the queue steps up automatically

### What You'll See During a Session

- **Head-to-head prediction** at the top: shows the all-time win percentage between the two current players (e.g. "Shay wins 62% of the time")
- **Session score** between the two players (e.g. "3-1")
- **Next Up** queue: shows who's waiting to play, with the next challenger highlighted in gold
- **Running totals** along the bottom: each player's emoji and frame count for the session

### Win Streaks

When a player wins several frames in a row, the app calls it out:
- 2 in a row: *"2 in a row!"*
- 3 in a row: *"Hat trick!"*
- 4 in a row: *"On fire! 4 straight!"*
- 5+: *"UNSTOPPABLE!"*

The streak message appears in gold and a special sound plays.

### Mid-Session Options

Along the bottom of the screen during a session, you'll find these buttons:

| Button | What it does |
|--------|-------------|
| **Undo** | Takes back the last frame (asks you to confirm first) |
| **+Player** | Adds another player to the session mid-way through |
| **Speaker icon** | Turns sounds on or off |
| **Record checkbox** | Starts or stops video recording |
| **End Session** | Finishes the session (asks you to confirm) |

### Changing the Matchup

Don't want to follow the automatic queue? Tap **Change Players** to manually pick who plays next.

### Ending a Session

1. Tap **End Session** at the bottom
2. Confirm by tapping **Yes, End**
3. The final standings appear with gold, silver, and bronze rankings
4. A fanfare sound plays
5. Tap **Done** to go back to the home screen

## Achievements

Players earn badges for milestones. These unlock automatically — you don't need to do anything.

Some examples:

| Badge | What you need to do |
|-------|-------------------|
| First Blood | Win your first ever frame |
| Double Digits | Win 10 frames total |
| Half Century | Win 50 frames total |
| Century | Win 100 frames total |
| Hat Trick | Win 3 in a row in a session |
| On Fire | Win 5 in a row in a session |
| Flawless | Win all your frames in a session (at least 3 wins, no losses) |
| Clean Sweep | Beat every opponent in a session |
| Comeback King | Come back from 3+ down against an opponent to overtake them |
| Regular | Play 10 sessions |
| Giant Killer | Beat the current monthly number 1 |

When someone unlocks a new achievement, a gold notification pops up on screen.

To see all badges, go to **Stats** > pick a player > tap the **Badges** tab.

## Checking Stats and Leaderboards

Tap the **Stats** tab at the bottom.

### Player Stats

1. Pick a player from the dropdown
2. Three sub-tabs:
   - **Overview**: Total wins/losses, win percentage, sessions played, best session, current form (last 5 sessions)
   - **Head-to-Head**: Record against each opponent they've played
   - **Badges**: All achievements — earned ones glow gold, unearned ones are faded

### Leaderboards

1. Tap the **Leaderboards** tab
2. Choose a time period: **Monthly**, **Yearly**, or **All Time**
3. Use the dropdowns to pick the specific month or year
4. The table shows rankings with wins, losses, and win percentage

## Viewing Past Sessions

Tap the **History** tab to see every session that's been played, newest first. Each entry shows:
- The date
- How many players and frames
- Who won

Tap a session to see the full frame-by-frame breakdown.

---

## Camera and Recordings

### Camera Tab

If OBS Studio is connected, the Camera tab shows a live preview of the table camera. You can also manually start and stop recordings from here.

### Recordings Tab

Browse and play back recorded frame videos. Tap any recording to watch it. If the video doesn't play in the browser, it may need to be opened in VLC.

## The Monthly Leaderboard (Home Screen)

When no session is active, the Home screen shows **This Month's** leaderboard — a quick glance at who's on top right now. This resets at the start of each month.

---

## Tips

- **The app remembers everything.** If the power goes out mid-session, just reopen the app — it picks up where you left off.
- **You can mute sounds** by tapping the speaker icon during a session.
- **Archived players aren't deleted.** Their history is kept. You can bring them back any time from the Players page.
- **The winner always stays on.** That's the rule — win and you keep playing. Lose and you go to the back of the queue.
- **Tap the winner, not the loser.** The big buttons during a game are for recording who won. Just tap the winner.
